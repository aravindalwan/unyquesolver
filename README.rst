UnyQuE
======

``UnyQuE`` is a framework for modeling and simulating the effect of uncertainties on engineering systems. The name UnyQuE stands for Uncertainty Quantification Environment. UnyQuE provides a framework for uncertainty quantification through the following steps:

* Constructing a stochastic model to describe all the sources of uncertainty
* Building a numerical model to simulate the engineering system behavior
* Propogation of the stochastic model through the system with precision
* Computing the statistics of desired output parameters of interest
